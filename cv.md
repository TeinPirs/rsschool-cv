### Briefly About Myself:

Hi! I work as a marketer. My career began with the layout of product cards. More precisely, by adding a small part of the content information to a small block on the site.

Now my job is more related to communicating with the web department and developers directly, so I want to explore more information related to website development. I hope that RS School will help me with this.

Good luck to me and all those who read this text.

### Code example:

**Peak array index KATA from CODEWARS:**
Given two integer arrays where the second array is a shuffled duplicate of the first array with one element missing, find the missing element.

Please note, there may be duplicates in the arrays, so checking if a numerical value exists in one and not the other is not a valid solution.

The first array will always have at least one element.


```javascript
function findMissing(arr1, arr2) {
    arr1.sort();
    arr2.sort();
    for(let i =0; i < arr1.length; i++){
      if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]){
        return arr1[i]
      }
    }
  }
```
